# Xpense 
A React-native expense tracking and management app 

---

Xpense is an effort to facilitate tracking and organization of daily financial transactions, along with providing a visual overview of the data. It allows the user to not only note the transactions as they desire but also categorize them with the ability to create automatically recurring transactions, view statistical reports and search through stored transactions with ease. It is primarily compatible with Android devices but can also be expanded to other platforms (like iOS) as it is built 
using the cross-platform technology of React-native.

## Features

### Expenditure Tracking
